Something always stuck in my mind is some kind words from a person with the type of success I aspire to achieve. "As long as you keep working, there is going to be a payoff. It may not be soon, but with enough time, it'll happen." In my narcissistic mind, I convinced myself I was smart enough to coast my way through the last few years, waiting for a payoff I never deserved. This blog is me putting a foot forward and putting myself out there.
    
## Some History

I was recently scrolling through Reddit. I came across a post speaking on how detrimental it is to coast through High School. Boy was that true. My first quarter at UC Davis was a rude awakening. Back then, I thought I was going to work in Computer Science, but I barely survived the introductory courses for object-oriented programming. It was clear I could not be laid back in this new environment. By the end of my freshman year, I needed to switch majors. CS was a bust for me, and I was on academic probation. I simply looked at what subject I had completed the most units in. Mathematics... 
    
In most Mathematics programs, there are usually lower-class introductory courses dealing in abstraction and proof-based work. I took a swing at Introductory Real Analysis. This course aimed to develope basic proof techniques more than anything. And I failed it. Hard. My first midterm I scored an amazing 16/100. I perservered, as the class average was 27. My last memory of that course was myself crying during my final.

My next decision might have been the most important of my academic career. I opted to try again. My second swing at Introductory Real Analysis netted me a cool B+ overall. This was satisfying enough for me to stick with mathematics. I am very blessed to have stuck with it. I can honestly say my time with the department was the best part of my life thus far. Even so, I realized I am not of the right caliber to pursue a career in academics. Everything in life seems to be risk reward, and I definitely can't risk the type of money graduate school requires. Maybe in the future, but by my Senior year, I knew I needed to expand my skillset. I opted to stay another year to double major in Statistics. After all, it's just applied maths, right??
    
Eventually, I graduated with a B.S. in Mathematics and Statistics in 2016. Since then, I've doubled down on bad decisions. I let myself coast through life again... As I reflect on my time since graduation, I've come to accept that I have shot myself in the foot. How could I expect to net an entry level job in data science when I have no proof of knowledge, no internships, etc... 
    
## Blog Goals

If there is anything I hope to accomplish with this new venture, it is to be a journal of my own milestones. I'm confident there are plenty of others like myself, hoping to self-educate in Python, R, and other languages with the goal of analytics in mind. Hopefully I there will be something here to offer to those people.
